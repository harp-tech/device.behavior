# Harp.Behavior.App

The Harp Behavior GUI application can be used to configure and test Harp Behavior devices.

The GUI was developed using [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) with ReactiveUI and makes direct use of the [Bonsai.Harp](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/harp) library.

As with other Harp devices, the Behavior can also be used in [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/).

## Installation

Go to the Releases page to download the latest version for your Operating System.

Currently there are x64 builds for Windows and Linux. Mac builds will be available in the future.

Portable builds are also available.

### Linux

Since the application accesses the serial port, your user needs to be on the `dialout` group or equivalent.

There might be other alternatives to this, but at least on Ubuntu and Fedora que command that you need to run to add your user to the `dialout` group is:

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G dialout <USERNAME>
```

## For developers

### Build Windows installer using NSIS manually

- Install NSIS 3 on your Windows machine
- Build and publish the application using the .NET 8 SDK command-line tools
  ```
      dotnet publish Harp.Behavior.App.sln -r win-x64 -f net8.0 --self-contained /p:Configuration=Release
  ```
- Run makesis to generate the installer
    ```
     makensis.exe /DVERSION_MAJOR=1 /DVERSION_MINOR=2 /DVERSION_BUILD=0 /DARCHITECTURE=win-x64 .\Harp.Behavior.nsi
     // Adjust the version numbers and architecture as needed (e.g., arm64)
    ```
- The installer will be available at `.\bin\Release\net8.0\<ARCHITECTURE>\Harp.Behavior.App.vx.x.x-<ARCHITECTURE>.exe`

### Build .app image for macOS

The project uses dotnet-bundle (https://github.com/egramtel/dotnet-bundle) to generate a .app image for macOS.

To build the .app image, run the following commands on the solution folder:

```sh
dotnet restore -r osx-x64 -p:TargetFramework=net8.0
dotnet msbuild -t:BundleApp -p:RuntimeIdentifier=osx-x64 -property:Configuration=Release -p:UseAppHost=true -p:TargetFramework=net8.0
```

### Build tar.gz package for Linux (either in Linux or WSL)

To build the tar.gz package, run the following commands on the solution folder:

First you need to make sure that the [`dotnet-packaging`](https://github.com/quamotion/dotnet-packaging) tool is installed

Run the following commands to install the tool:

```sh
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-tarball
```

Then run the following commands to build the tar.gz package:

```sh
dotnet restore -r linux-x64 -p:TargetFramework=net8.0
dotnet msbuild -p:RuntimeIdentifier=linux-x64 -property:Configuration=Release -p:UseAppHost=true -p:TargetFramework=net8.0 /t:CreateTarball
```
